            <div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">I HATE GLOBALISM.</span><p><span class="headline hl4">by Abdrakhman Mukhammed</span></p></div>
          In our time, globalization is spreading very much in developed countries. At first glance, globalization is a very good and harmless movement among people. It calls for honesty, respect for different members of society. But if you look at this topic even deeper, you can see more, and so in this post, I would like to tell why I think so.<br>
          <br> <strong>3 REASONS WHY I HATE GLOBALISM:</strong><p> 1) Before following any rules, I always study the person who invented these rules. Alexander the Great is one of the first who supported the idea of globalization. He conquered a lot of land in his time and he wanted to create a single system in which people had to follow. The main difference between the old globalization and the globalization of our time is that, in those days, people were forced, but in our time it is doing by other ways, such as to entice people.<br><br>

        2) Globalization supports dirty people. I call them dirty because they're willing to sell themselves for money. I agree that the 21st century is the century of freedom. However, because of such dirty people in our society, there are a lot of troubles and incurable diseases. Many people say that in today's world, people can do what they want. Sometimes in this way people go beyond the limits of human value.
        <br><br>
        3) Globalism seeks to demonize the idea of Western culture and sovereignty. If they succeed, you will eventually become ashamed that you ever thought that there was something special about your culture, the traditions you celebrated and even the foods that you prefer.

        By drawing conclusion, I want to say that there are things in the world that need to be studied and only then decide whether to follow these rules.</p></div>

            <div class="head"><span class="headline hl5">Abay Kunanbaev</span><p><span class="headline hl6">from literature</span></p></div>
            Abay Kunanbaev (1845-1904). Abay was born in 1845 at the bottom of the Chingiz Mountain in the today‚Äôs Abai district (former Karkaraly) located in Eastern Kazakhstan region (formerly, the Semipalatinsk region).

            He was a well-known Kazakh poet, a great thinker, composer, philosopher, the founder of written Kazakh literature, and its first classic.</p>

            <p>The heritage he left his nation is rich in songs and poems, translations and prose. His translations of the poetry written by Russian writers and poets such as Pushkin, Lermontov, and Krylov became the national patrimony of Kazakhstan. He translated the works of Schiller, Goethe, and Byron into Kazakh language.

              Abai Kunanbaev is the Shakesphere of Kazakh literature. His Book of Words, ¬´Kara Sozder¬ª, created by the great thinker constitute an ethnic philosophical work. This creation of his is an exploration of Kazakh national life in the second half of the 19th century. He influenced social affairs in the country where he lived.</p>

            <p>The name of Abai is known worldwide just as Shakespeare, Goethe, and Pushkin are well-known in many countries, because his great words became a spiritual patrimony of not only one nation, but of the entire humankind.</p>

        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">HOW TO CONVERT ‚ÄúNEED‚Äù TO ‚ÄúWANT‚Äù </span><p><span class="headline hl4">Just recomendations</span></p></div><p>To determine the true desires and the notion of a ‚Äúwant‚Äù or ‚Äúneed‚Äù situation, identify all the most critical moments of the problem. Take a diary (a notebook, a sheet of paper) and write down all the items called ‚Äúneed‚Äù in it - going to work, eating healthy (but unloved) food, spending weekends with your relatives   and so on. When all the "necessary" will be lit, look at them from a different angle. Think and find all the advantages that have not been noticed before. Take advantage from unpleasant things. Work is income (and therefore the possibility of spending money not only on food but also on entertainment). Refusal of junk food is a healthy organism, the path to a slim figure. Communicating with the relatives of your second half is an opportunity to find companions in their person in case help is needed.
          Look at life with a positive, and even in the most unpleasant duty, look for at least a small amount of positive things for yourself.</p></div>

          something must be wrong when almost every single song has sex as its
          basis.<br>
          when rap stars get famous after making lyrics that are shameless,<br>
          when a woman is expected to sleep with a man who doesn‚Äôt even know what her name is.‚Äù<br><br>

          When the world is developing in terms of technology, it is deteriorating in terms of morality . In the top of the charts has always led a song about debauchery. In turn, these songs are popular among young people. Otherwise, there would be no such ratings. Such songs educate people for the worse </p>

					<p>Rap has become overly popular because it's easier. It removes four of the six basic principles of vocality. Vocalists have always made use of key, pitch, melody, sometimes harmony, rhythm and rhyme. Rappers only use rhythm and rhyme. They needn't worry about key, pitch, melody, harmony or any of the other things vocalists typically deal with. Don't get me wrong there are some very talented rappers out there, but essentially it's breaking down vocals to their principal pieces and then only using those that aren't intrinsically visceral. Beats and rhythms are more primal than lofty melodies and complex harmonies. They might carry more "oomph" or emotion or passion, but in doing so they lose the techniques that balance music on that thin passion/technique line. I'm not saying just anyone can rap, but more can rap than can sing. It's more natural and requires less training. So it's more acceptable to the common audience listener. </p></div>
